# DevOps Project

## 1. Application
It's a Frontend/Backend application with basic CRUD features, developed using the MERN stack. You can access the application [Here](http://20.74.93.255/)

## 2. Observability
### 1. Logging
I used winston on nodejs to enable logging
those are the logs generated by app

We can see tha we have a request id

### 2. Metrics
I used prom-client to congigure metrics in my application.
This is the first metric of tghe total requests

My business metric is the total_tasks in my kanban dashboard

I visualized these metrics in grafana dashboard

## 3. Deployment
I built the frontend and the backend using docker and then I deployed them using kubernetes. This is the architecture of the deployment of the application

 ## 4. Automation
 For the automation I used 3 stacks
 ### 1. Kubernetes Cluster provisioning
 Here I provisioned an AKS cluster whithin an existiong resource group
 
 ### 2. Application deployment 
 To automate the deployment of my application, I created a Helm Chart and I made the docker image name, the replicas and the http ports configurable via values.yaml.  I also made it possible to add arbitrary labels to the deployment via the file values.yaml
 
 ### 3. Monitoring automation
here I created the monitoring setup for our application using Kubernetes provider as well as Helm provider. This stackk will install prometheus, grafana and datadog on our cluster in order to monitor our application
